# _semiotic
because downloading malware is fun...

## Overview
_semiotic is a resource repository for binaries exploitation and reverse engineering. You will find here some tutorials on building secure sandboxes, malware sampling, static and dynamic analysis, unpacking, firmware extraction, hardware hacking [ in x86, ARM, powerpc, mips ...] and way more fun stuff. Here I will engage in some real-world case studies by downloading, executing, digesting and recreating some wild malware while also creating a resource library filled with reports and toolkits.
