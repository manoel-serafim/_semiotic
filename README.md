# _semiotic
_semiotic is a resource for binary reverse engineering, sampling, and analysis. This platform will offer tutorials on building secure sandboxes, malware sampling, static and dynamic analysis, unpacking, firmware extracting and more. Here I will engage in real-world case studies while create a resource library filled with reports and toolkits.
